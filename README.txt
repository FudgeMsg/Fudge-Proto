The Fudge Proto implementation is designed to specify the logical content of
a Fudge encoded message that can be automatically targeted to structured data
types convenient for use in application development. Serialization to/from
high level data structures is then automated, allowing Fudge to be used as
part of an integration between different development environments (e.g. a C#
and a Java application).
